            <p> 
                King Ramses Curse: is likely the most iconic episode of the series overall. 
                The uncanny nature of the CG King Ramses (who threatens Courage with a curse) 
                is still a very creepy image after all these years. It helped the series make 
                an impact early on in its run, and it's likely why anyone remembers Courage the Cowardly Dog to this day.

                Muted Muriel: This list had to include Shirley somewhere in it as she's one of the more common chaotic presences in Courage's life, 
                but her episodes come with an undeserving edge. Someone's usually punished (Eustace, in most cases) when they slight her, 
                so she curses them in some way. But the best use of her actually comes completely at random when Muriel decides to stop speaking when Eustace ignores her. 
                As a result Courage seeks out Shirley's help, only for her to summon a giant starfish that would destroy the world unless Muriel spoke. 
                It ends up making for one of the funniest uses of her chaos, and helps to showcase more of Muriel as she actually sticks up for herself to Eustace's abuse. 
                It's rare, but always fun when it happens.
