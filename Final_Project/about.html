            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>
            My name is Ashley Visher and I am an entrepreneur. I grew this passion when I came up with the idea to make homemadecandles. I 
            first wanted to just do it as a hobby but after a while I wanted to let others try them as well. When I first started out they were 
            TERRIBLE. But that only made me want to get better. I had the right idea but at that moment I knew I need to be more invested. So I 
            started doing research after research... motivated to make my candles better. It took some time but I eventually got it together and 
            started selling my candles. 

            This taught me how to communicate and connect with others. As my product got out there I started asking for reviews and was just happy
            from what I was hearing. I was so happy to hear how much they improved that I then began to update my quality to make my candles even 
            more better. After a while they started burning slower and lasting longer with an amazing strong scents.
