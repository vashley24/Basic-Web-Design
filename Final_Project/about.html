            <h2>Character Profiles</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Courage is a small pink dog of undetermined breed (possibly a mix breed) (beagle) 
                    with thin and long black ears. He has a black triangular nose and tiny limbs in 
                    proportion to his body. His middle toe always seems to point straight ahead regardless 
                    of stance, making it appear as though Courage is always tip-toeing. He has numerous 
                    large human-like teeth, with one having a circular cavity in it. He has three black spots on his back.
                </li>
                <li>Muriel Bagge: A Scottish elderly woman, Muriel is the kind and sweet owner of Courage, 
                    as well as the industrious wife of Eustace Bagge. Though she is the show's damsel-in-distress, 
                    Muriel is also an excellent cook and refuses to tolerate any nonsense or misbehavior - 
                    she employs her weapon of choice (a rolling pin) to smack Eustace whenever he scares, teases, 
                    abuses, or otherwise mistreats Courage.
                </li>
                <li>Eustace Bagge: Murielâ€™s grumpy husband, descriptions of his antics. He is a farmer who lives in the 
                    middle of Nowhere, Kansas with his wife Muriel Bagge and her dog Courage. He is usually antagonistic 
                    to Courage, but has frequently had to ally with or be rescued by Courage, occasionally showing him 
                    respect as a result
                </li>
                <li>Fred: "Freaky Fred" to visit his aunt. Though Muriel seems quite fond of him, he is disliked by 
                    Eustace who calls him a "Freak" and by Courage who is terrified of him. Eustace calls Fred a "Freak" 
                    and said in reference to him: "The freak's a barber, a freaky barber, with his own freaky barber shop, 
                    where freaky things happen, freaky barber things." He is considered to be one of the scariest villains 
                    in the series Courage has faced.
                </li>
                <li>Katz: Katz is a red cat with thin limbs and a long body. He has yellow eyes with small pupils and violet 
                    highlights on the lower lids, as well as violet-tipped ears, a violet-tipped nose and three violet stripes 
                    across his back. Although he doesn't appear to have eyebrows, sometimes he does, such as in his debut. 
                    He is a master of disguise and even dresses up to match the scam he's planning.
                </li>
            </ul>
