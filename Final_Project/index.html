        <h1>What is an Entrepreneur?</h1>

        <p>
            An entrepreneur is an individual who starts and runs a business with limited resources. This individual is responsible for all the risks and rewards of their business venture.
            The business idea usually encompasses a new product or service rather than an existing business model.

            Entrepreneurial ventures target high returns with an equally high level of uncertainty. The entrepreneur is willing to risk their financial security and career,
             spending time as well as capital on an uncertain venture, arranging for the necessary capital, raw materials, manufacturing locations, and skilled employees.
             Marketing, sales, and distribution are other important aspects that are controlled by the entrepreneur.

            The risk is still carried by the entrepreneur even if some of these functions are outsourced. This makes entrepreneurship different from inheriting and/or running an existing business,
            working for a startup or entrepreneur for a salary, being a commissioned agent, or selling already available goods or services as a franchisee or dealership.
