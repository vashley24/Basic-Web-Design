            <h1>My Experience As A Beginning Entrepreneur</h1>

            <p>
            As a new entrepreneur it was definitly scary and it had many challenges. Investing your time and effort into something you have no idea how it would pan out is terrifying.
            The candles business I started was just the beginning of my journey. I started making candles in 2019 but the real experience started in 2020. It started as an group business. It 
            was four of us and we came to the conclusion to sell hair. The beauty industry is a high demand so we knew it was the best fit. Everyone had their part to do however i felt as if 
            mines was most important. 
            </p>

            <p>
            I was in charge of finding the hair vendor, setting prices and most of all research. Starting a business I realized that it was my job to know about any competition and also what 
            they is offering. Knowing this gave me an insight on how to compete with them and to stand out from them. What would give us the most attraction?
