            <h2>Did You Know</h2>

            <p>
                The show is set in a town called Nowhere, which is actually a real place in New Mexico. In real life, an elderly couple who lived in 
                Nowhere with their pet dog frequently reported bizarre and paranormal activity, including a creature they identified as a Skin Walker. 
                After their report, the couple went missing under strange circumstances. Only the dog was found.

                The show ran from November 1999 to November 2002, when it was cancelled after 52 episodes spanning over four seasons. 
                Cartoon Network gave Courage the axe when a coalition of mothers complained that an episode featuring a relationship 
                between a female fox and female rabbit depicted lesbian symbolism.
