            <p>Lisa Valente, M.S., R.D., <a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291719/why-cooking-no-matter-the-recipe-is-better-for-your-health/">nutrition editor for EatingWell and Cooking Light</a>, says one of the best parts about cooking at home is controlling the ingredients so you know exactly what you're eating.

                This is important not only for people with dietary restrictions-as it can be frustrating figuring out which items at a restaurant are safe to eat-but also for anyone trying to eat healthier.
                You control the amount of salt, added sugar and spice going into your food when you're in charge-and can adjust it to suit your tastes. You can also follow your cravings while sticking to a 
                healthy eating regimen by making lighter versions of your favorite meals.</p>
